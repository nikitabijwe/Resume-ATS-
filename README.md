Welcome to Resume Genie, a Resume ATS Feedback powered by the Google Gemini Pro Vision LLM Model.

This project was born from a personal journey fueled by a desire to transform these challenges into opportunities for growth. Leveraging Google's generative AI, Gemini, I set out to create more than just an applicationâ€”it's a lifeline for job seekers, offering not only feedback and insights but also a sense of validation and support in an otherwise daunting process.

## Overview
Resume Genie is an innovative tool designed to provide summary and feedback on Resume by analyzing both the job description and the candidate's resume.
